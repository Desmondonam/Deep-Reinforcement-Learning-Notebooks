# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Notebooks
This Repository contains a series of google colab notebooks which I created to help people dive into deep reinforcement learning.This notebooks contains both theory and implementation of different algorithms. 

Part-1 => This notebook provides you with a brief introduction of Reinforcement Learning(RL) and common terminologies used in RL.

Part-2 => This notebook provides you with a theory behind REINFORCE algorithm and also with its implemenation in tensorflow.

Part-3 => This notebook provides you with a theory behind SARSA algorithm and also with its implemenation in tensorflow.

Part-4 => This notebook provides you with a theory behind Deep Q-Networks(DQN) algorithm and also with its implemenation in tensorflow.

Part-5 => This notebook discusses some problems we have while using the Deep Q-Networks algorithm (DQN) and how we can improve DQN. It provides you with a theory behind Double DQN with Prioritized Experience Replay(PER) and target networks and also with its implemenation in tensorflow.

Part-6 => This notebook provides you with a theory behind Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm and also with its implemenation in tensorflow.
